I started playing computer games on the ZX Spectrum in the middle of the '80s and did my first computer course leraning MS-DOS at Infor Jovem programme (...), at the beggining of my teenage.

I work in IT for more than two decades, mainly in Systems, Networking, Infraestructures and Operations.

I collaborate with students, professionals and companies of all sizes and sectors, from individual entrepreneurs to multinationals with hundreds of thousands of employees.

I like to be useful and help in the areas in which I work or am interested, sharing ideas, experiences or projects.

In this space, I record what I don't want to lose due to time passing or (lack of) memory.
